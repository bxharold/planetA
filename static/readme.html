<h1>Project:  PlanetA</h1>

<h4>Video Demo:  <URL HERE></h4>

<h4>Description: <code>PlanetA</code> is a full-stack Flask app that uses Python, Sqlite and Javascript to implement a browser-based graphical display that shows, in compressed time, the locations and relative magnitudes of earthquakes.  It can also display the location of the International Space Station (ISS).</h4>

<h2>PlanetA has 3 components:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Earthquake sequence visualization </li>
<li>ISS tracker 

<ul>
<li>The display for earthquakes and ISS is Web browser and an HTML5 canvas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A data aggregator utility <code>dbquakes4planet.py</code>

<ul>
<li>command-line program generating Sqlite tables for the earthquake sequence visualization component</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>USGS earthquake data aggregator:</h2>

<p><code>dbquakes4planet.py</code> is a command-line utility that pulls earthquake event data within a specified data range from the online USGS database. It stores extracts (with additional calculated columns to handle the earthquake animation) in tables in a Sqlite database <code>quakes.db</code>.</p>

<h2>Earthquake visualizer:</h2>

<p>The browser front-end displays an animation of locations, magnitudes, and time intervals of a set of earthquakes. The UI presents a pulldown list of all available tables that were created by the earthquake data aggregator app, <code>dbquakes4planet.py</code>.</p>

<p>In the browser, I use the javascript async/await/promise approach to schedule the steps if the animation, based on the time difference between successive earthquake events.
I use an HTML5 canvas for the visual display, with a background image that shows, for reference, tectonic plate boundaries.</p>

<p>The <code>/loadActiveQuakeTable</code> route retrieves the earthquake events from the
local backend Sqlite database, and returns this as a JSON response to the browser. The browser intializes a global javascript object with this, and getJSON's 
the <code>/loadActiveQuakeTableParams</code>
route to return parameters that govern the display.</p>

<h2>ISS Tracker:</h2>

<p>This displays the location of the International Space Station in real time, with an update every 5 seconds.</p>

<p>The route /issdata accesses the api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json API which
provides the latitude/longitude. It then uses the nominatim API for
reverse geolocation, mapping lat/lon coords to a country or ocean. I added
a route to drill down to (approx) the specific ocean. </p>

<h2>External APIs:  USGS, ISS, Nominatim</h2>

<ul>
<li>open-notify.org      for realtime ISS location</li>
<li>earthquake.usgs.gov  for earthquake data</li>
<li>Nominatim            API and library for reverse geolocation</li>
</ul>

<h1>Development Notes:</h1>

<p>The realtime ISS location data comes from the open-notify.org JSON API. </p>

<p>The javascript animation for ISS Tracker is quite simple: 
Every 5 seconds, get a location, draw a dot, repeat. HTML canvas and javascript's 
setInterval() were appropriate for the realtime display updates.</p>

<p>For the earthquake data, I used a local backend database which I populated off-line 
from the USGS earthquake JSON API. For each date range (specified as command-line
parameters to <code>dbquakes4planet.py</code>), I create a separate table, with added 
calculated columns to simplify the animation display.  This list of tables
is presented in the "Earthquake Sequencer" tab as a selection list.</p>

<p>The earthquakes animation in javascript was not as trivial as the "setTimeout()" 
that I used for ISS Tracker. I wanted an explicit "delay" in the javascript loop 
that generated a sequence of DOM updates, drawing a programmatically-determined-sized 
dot on the canvas and updating text areas with a delay time based on a call to a route 
that I defined in planetA.py. I used Javascript's async/await/promise approach for this.</p>

<h2>My motivation for this particular project:</h2>

<p>Some background: I first stumbled onto CS50 a year ago when I was building a browser-based front-end controller for an Arduino/Raspberry PI project. 
I had decided to use a REST framework, 
but I had very little experience with REST APIs.  After watching the CS50
lecture 9 on Flask/Jinja2, I backtracked, completed CS50, and then enrolled in CS50p. 
It seemed "natural" for my CS50p final project to be a full-stack Flask app. </p>

<h3>Why earthquakes?</h3>

<p>My interest in watching the progression of earthquakes in condensed time 
started with a display at the Yellowstone Visitor Center, a globe with
blinking lights. I decided the CS50p final project provided a good excuse to
build a web version. </p>

<h2>Implementation Stages:</h2>

<h3>A first step:</h3>

<p>I wrote the ISS Tracker component as a "Hello, World" to get more practice in 
Flask/Python web development and the REST API programming model (consuming 
and writing API endpoints.) The tracker called the /isspath route, which
in turn retrieved the JSON from the open-notify.org API. At this point, the 
/isspath did not include the reverse geolocation functionality.
The animation just used a simple javascript setTimeout() loop.  </p>

<h3>Working with the local backend database</h3>

<p>The next steps were to build the earthquake data aggregator app, <code>dbquakes4planet.py</code>,
store a few tables, build the web UI that enabled selecting the table and displaying
the data on a web page. The UI is under the "Earthquake Sequencer" tab, which goes to
the /kwaks route. The "Raw Earthquake Data" link, which goes to the /quakedata route,
displays the selected table's data.</p>

<h3>Developing the canvas animation:</h3>

<p>At its core, my animation, or sequential updating of the canvas, is <code>repeat {draw; delay}</code>. Javascript has no built-in "delay". The async await/promise model that could
implement a delay was new to me, and so I added a simple "demo" mode to
ISS Tracker. This is implemented in the route /get<em>isspath</em>JSON.</p>

<h3>Displaying the earthquakes</h3>

<p>Combining these steps, I built the display for the earthquakes. The plan was
to iterate over the table, and draw a dot after waiting for an amount of time
proportional to the difference in time between events. The async await/promise 
model gave me the "delay" functionality.</p>

<h3>How to highlight the last dot drawn?</h3>

<p>Essentially, for the N^th^ quake in my table, I wanted to draw the first N-1 dots in black, and then the N^th^ in red.
In the Processing environment (which is optimized for graphics displays), I could loop over N (the number of quakes), 
and refresh the entire image at each iteration. That is not feasible with a browser canvas. </p>

<p>The solution was in a lyric to a Rolling Stones song that I had heard a day earlier:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>I see a red dot and I want it painted black.</em> </li>
</ul>

<p>I.e., for every new quake, repaint the previous dot black, then paint the new quake red.  </p>

<h3>Adding reverse geolocation:</h3>

<p>I wanted the ISS Tracker to display the geographic location in addition to the
latitude and longitude, similar to the earthquake feed. To do this, in the
/issdata route, I took the ISS location (http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json)
lat/lon data, and appended the geolocation data from the Nominatim API library.</p>

<h3>Porting to a Raspberry Pi for testing</h3>

<p>The Flask app is only known by its IP and port# (I have no local DNS.) 
I set a javascript vbl QPORT as a URI prefix (e.g., http://192.168.1.13:8787) 
To make my app IP- and port-independent, I specify the port as an arg when 
I start the Flask server. I let Python build the rest of the protocol-ip-port 
string, and I pass that (via render_template) to each page that contains 
javascript to do getJSON() requests back to routes in the Flask app. 
(I do this once, in layout.html) 
To make the vbl QPORT accessible in javascript, I use a script in the page body:
  - <code>&lt;script&gt; QPORT="{{QPORT|safe}}"&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>

<h2>In hindsight:</h2>

<ol>
<li>I spent way more time with javascript than I expected.

<ul>
<li>Graphics was easy; animation harder.</li>
<li>This was a good exercise in flask/js 2-way communication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To quote Piet Hein, creator of the Soma puzzle, "Problems worthy of attack prove their worth by fighting back."  I intentionally designed this to be a learning project, and I can confidentally say that it proved its worth.  </li>
<li>This was a good excuse to finally learn how to use Git and GitHub.</li>
